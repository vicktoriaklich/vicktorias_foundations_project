   <h2>What is SMART Closet?</h2>
   <h3>- Our goal is to make people aware of the fact that clothes and a style of one's own are something wonderful, but do not have to be equally expensive and harmful to the environment. With this application you can not only organize your own wardrobe, but also be informed. -</h3>
   <br>
   <h2>So what's the idea?</h2>
   <h3>SMART Closet will be launched as an application for any device, where you can store and organize your own closet by taking picture of your pieces. You will be able to add any kind of Description and assign them to categories and seasons. You will be able to create and plan your outfits based on the things you already own.</h3>
   <h2>But wait, theres more!</h2>
   <h3>We want to support your love for fashion but also create some awarness. Just because you choose the same outfits more often than trying something new by recombining this doesn't mean that it is worth it to buy new things constanly - and we know - new clothes can make you super happy.</h3><br><h3>So, SMART Closet collects the information needed to display everything you need to know about the brand, like the production and if it's environmentally friendly produced.</h3>
